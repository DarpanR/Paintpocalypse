# 🎨 Paintpocalypse

A 2D competitive, fast-paced bullet hell survival game made in Unity — where chaos is drawn by the players themselves.

## 🕹️ Game Concept

**Paintpocalypse** pits two players against each other in an MS Paint-inspired battlefield. One plays as the **stickman**, using the keyboard to survive waves of horde attacks. The other is the **Mouse**, spawning in enemies and manipulating the battlefield with classic paint tools like Fill, Spray, Line, and Eraser.

The game features:
- Asymmetric two-player gameplay (keyboard vs mouse)
- Dynamic horde-based enemy waves (shapes)
- Tool-based mechanics (both as weapons and modifiers)
- A progression system (XP, leveling, and potential shops)
- Fast-paced action and high replayability

## 🎮 Theme & Narrative

Set inside a fake MS Paint canvas, the game explores the tension between **control and chaos**. The Stickman is an anomaly trying to escape deletion, while the Mouse, a symbolic force of creative control, tries to wipe him out by painting his doom.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Implement unique **asymmetric gameplay** for two players
- Create custom MS Paint-style **tools** as gameplay mechanics
- Build scalable **horde AI** and progression system
- Emphasize fun, replayability, and balance
- Stylize the game using nostalgic and crude **MS Paint aesthetics**
